# Cosmology class technical project

This repo is based on the CMBAnalysis_SummerSchool here https://github.com/jeffmcm1977/CMBAnalysis_SummerSchool. 

The primary progress made so far includes a thorough exploration of Notebooks 1 and 2, along with an analysis of the ACT_DR5_f150 map in CMB_Computational_Project.ipynb, where I constructed a power spectrum $\chi^2$ map.
